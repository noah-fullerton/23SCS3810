# Instructions

The first week of class discussed File Management Systems (FMS) which relies on files and folders to maintain data records. In this assignment you are asked to finish an implementation of a simple FMS to support a project management system for a mid-size company. A project has a title, start and end dates, and an estimated budget. Employees in the company are associated to one (an only one) project at a time. Also, each employee has an unique id, a name and works in a department. The database is stored in the "db" folder. 

Finish the TO-DO's embedded in the code:
