# Introduction

A container is a standardized software package that allows applications to run quickly and reliably in different computing environments​. A container packages up code and all its dependencies so applications can be easily deployed in different computer platforms. A container is created from a container image. A container engine runs containers​. Available for most popular platforms, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. 

Docker is a container image format and also a complete solution for software containerization. Download docker desktop from [docs.docker.com/desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop). Docker hub [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) is a public repository of docker images that are available to use, currently with > 7M images. 

# Setup Local Storage

Create a (local) folder fo all of the databases you will be creating this semester using postgres. Make sure you know the absolute path to this folder. For example: 

```
/Users/tmota/devel/teach/__23SCS3810_DB/postgres
```

# Running Postgres as a Container

Download the postgres (standard) docker image from Docker hub using: 

```
docker pull postgres
```

Then start your postgres container from the image that you downloaded using: 

```
docker run --rm --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=135791 -v /Users/tmota/devel/teach/__23SCS3810_DB/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres



// THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
// THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!

docker run --rm --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=135791 -v C:\Users\noahm\PycharmProjects\23SCS3810\postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres

try making path c:\\database\\
```

The command above will start postgres using 135791 as the password for the postgres (default) user.  Note the use of -e parameter (useful to set environment variables) for your container. The environment variables that need to be set is container-dependent. Also note the -v parameter which allows mapping the container's postgres storage to a local folder of your choice. 

# Starting a psql Session

On another terminal window, use docker exec to start psql session to connect with the DBMS. 

```
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
```

# Create a Database 

Use the following commands to create a simple database for testing purposes. 

```
CREATE DATABASE test;

\c test

CREATE TABLE Employees (
 id INT PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL,
 sal INT ); 

INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
 (101, 'Sam Mai Tai', 35000),
 (202, 'Morbid Mojito', 65350); 
```

Use the following command to display all employees: 

```
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

To quit psql just run exit or \q. 

# Reconnect

To make sure your database is preserved, use CTRL-C to stop your container image from running. Than recreate a container from the postgres image using:  

```
docker run --rm --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=135791 -v /Users/tmota/devel/teach/__23SCS3810_DB/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```

docker run --rm --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=135791 -v C:\Users\noahm\PycharmProjects\23SCS3810\postgres postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres


On another terminal window, use docker exec to start psql session to connect with the DBMS. 

```
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
```

Use the following commands to display all employees: 

```
\c test 

SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

You should be able to see all of the employees inserted previously. When you are done, exit psql using \q.
